# Forbidden cases (necessary condition, part 2)

Color compatibility alone is not sufficient: `grid_hampath.py`'s
`is_forbidden` (cases for `width/height ∈ {1,2,3}`) rules out additional
color-compatible pairs. This file ports those three cases directly and
proves the necessity theorem for case 1.

STATUS: proved (no `sorry`). The definitions are transcribed from the Python
(which was exhaustively cross-checked against brute-force search for all
`width,height` with `width*height ≤ 26`, including every case-3 instance --
see `verify.py`'s `exhaustive_characterization_check`, 0 mismatches). The
necessity proofs `isForbidden → ¬HasHamPath`: case 1 here
(`forbiddenCase1_implies_no_path`; a path on a width/height-1 grid has no
choice but to be the straight line); cases 2 and 3 in `Necessity.lean`
(`forbiddenCase2_implies_no_path`, a cut/separation argument, and
`forbiddenCase3_implies_no_path`, built on the tools in `F3.lean`). An
earlier version of this file stated them with `sorry`.

/-- Ported from `_is_forbidden_case_1`: when `width = 1` or `height = 1`, a
Hamiltonian path must be the straight line, so `{s,t}` must be exactly the
two extreme corners.

REVISION NOTE: originally stated using `Set Coord` equality (`{s,t} =
{(0,0), far}`), which is mathematically fine but unnecessarily hard to work
with in an actual proof (`Set` equality needs `Set.ext`-style unfolding, and
isn't `Decidable` in general). Rewritten as a plain `∨`/`∧`/`=` statement on
`Coord` directly, matching every other definition in this file -- this is
what a two-element set equality actually *means* for a two-element set, just
spelled out instead of routed through `Set`. -/

`s`,`t` are color-compatible. Transcribed directly from the Rust/Python

/-- The core combinatorial fact underlying `forbiddenCase1_implies_no_path`,
isolated as its own self-contained statement about plain `List ℕ` (no
`Coord`/grid vocabulary): a `Nodup`, unit-step-adjacent sequence that covers
exactly the interval `[k, k + length)` must run from one extreme of that
interval to the other, in one direction or the other. This is what forces a
Hamiltonian path on a width-1 (or height-1) grid to be monotonic -- a width-1
grid's vertices, read off by their single free coordinate, are *exactly*
such a sequence.

Proved below as `unitChain_endpoints`, by way of
`unitStepChain_intermediate`: a "unit chain" covering `[k, k+n)` that starts
at an *interior* point of that range would, followed in either direction,
run out of room on one side while the other side stays uncovered and
unreachable. -/

def unitStepChain : List ℕ → Bool

/-- **Discrete intermediate value property for unit-step chains.** If `x`
and `y` both appear in a unit-step chain `q`, every value between them also
appears -- regardless of `Nodup`; this is purely about connectivity of the
±1-step walk (to get from `x` to `y` via ±1 steps, you must pass through
every integer in between). This is the crux fact behind
`unitChain_endpoints`: an interior starting point `a` (with both `a-1` and
`a+1` present elsewhere, by full coverage of the range) would force the
walk to pass back through `a` to reach the far one -- contradicting
`Nodup`, since `a` is only visited once, at the start.

Proved by front-peeling induction, mirroring the exact structure already
confirmed working in `Coloring.lean`'s `chain_parity_alternates` (unfold
`unitStepChain` via `simpa [unitStepChain]`, split the `&&` via `simp`,
recover the underlying `Prop` from the `decide`-wrapped `Bool` via
`unfold ... ; by_contra ; simp [...]`). -/
