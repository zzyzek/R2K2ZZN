# Forbidden case 3: tools and base cases

Paths are lists, so "who is next to whom on the path" needs a small toolkit:

* `PNext p x y`: `y` immediately follows `x` in `p`;
* `pnext_adj`: path neighbours are grid-adjacent;
* `pnext_unique_right` / `pnext_unique_left`: in a list without repeats each
  cell has at most one successor and at most one predecessor;
* `no_prev_of_head`: the first cell has no predecessor;
* `interior_two`: a cell that is neither first nor last has a predecessor and
  a successor, and they are different;
* `forced_after_head`: if a middle cell's only possible path neighbours are the
  first cell `u` and one other cell, then it must come right after `u`.

Base case B0 (`b0_no_path`): on a 3-high grid, no Hamiltonian path starts at
`(0, 1)` and ends in a column `≥ 1`. Both corners `(0,0)` and `(0,2)` would
have to come right after `(0,1)`.

further right, there is no Hamiltonian path from `u` to `v`. Induction on
`u.x`: B0 for `u.x = 0`, B1 for `u.x = 1`, and the contraction C1 otherwise. -/
