# Color compatibility (necessary condition, part 1)

The grid graph is bipartite via the checkerboard coloring `(x+y) mod 2`.
A Hamiltonian path must alternate colors at every step, which forces a
relationship between the colors of its two endpoints and the parity of the
total vertex count -- this file is the Lean counterpart of
`are_color_compatible` / `_is_forbidden_case_*`'s color checks in
`grid_hampath.py`, together with a proof of the direction that actually
matters for a *necessary*-condition theorem: `HasHamPath → ColorCompatible`.

The even case follows from alternation alone. The odd case is a counting
argument: colours alternate along the path, so a path of odd length `n`
starting on colour 1 would visit `(n+1)/2` colour-1 cells, but the grid has
only `(n-1)/2` of them (`cnt1_grid`) and the path has no repeats.

former says `some x`, the latter computes to `x`. Proved from scratch by
induction rather than by citing a Mathlib lemma name -- see the note above
`chain_parity_head_last` for why. Each step relies only on `rfl` (both
`List.getLast` and `List.getLast?` reduce definitionally on a concrete
`cons`/`cons`/... pattern, exactly like `chainAdjacent` did in
`chain_parity_alternates` above) plus `injection` (a core tactic, not a
named lemma) to extract `a = x` from `some a = some x`. -/
